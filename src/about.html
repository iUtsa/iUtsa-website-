                <p>As an international student from Bangladesh, my academic journey in the USA has been complemented by extensive travel across the country.

Each destination has offered unique experiences—from the bustling streets and iconic landmarks of NYC to the historic charm of Philadelphia, the vibrant entertainment scene of Atlantic City, and the academic and cultural vibrancy of Boston. These travels have not only broadened my global perspective but have also deepened my appreciation for the diverse landscapes and cultures that make up the American experience.
