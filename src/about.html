                <p>As an international student from Bangladesh, my academic journey in the USA has been complemented by extensive travel across the country. I’ve had the chance to immerse myself in the cultural and historical richness of cities such as New York City, Philadelphia, Atlantic City, and Boston. Each destination has offered unique experiences—from the bustling streets and iconic landmarks of NYC to the historic charm of Philadelphia, the vibrant entertainment scene of Atlantic City, and the academic and cultural vibrancy of Boston. These travels have not only broadened my global perspective but have also deepened my appreciation for the diverse landscapes and cultures that make up the American experience.

                <h3>Music</h3>
                <p>Music has always been a significant part of my life. I enjoy playing a variety of instruments, including the harmonica, guitar, tabla, and harmonium. Whether I’m strumming chords on the guitar or performing classical rhythms on the tabla, music allows me to express my creativity and unwind. Singing and playing these instruments provide a way for me to connect with others and explore different musical traditions. This passion keeps me balanced and inspired, adding harmony to both my personal and professional pursuits.</p>
